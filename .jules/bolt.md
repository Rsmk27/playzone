## 2026-05-19 - Code Splitting App.jsx
**Learning:** Static imports for multiple nested components can balloon a React app's main bundle size.
**Action:** Always use `React.lazy()` and `<Suspense>` to lazy-load components such as individual games, only fetching them when the user actually navigates to them. This drastically reduces the main bundle size (e.g., from ~429KB to ~175KB in this project).
## 2026-05-19 - Batching Canvas Path Operations
**Learning:** Calling `ctx.strokeRect` in a tight loop for a grid is highly inefficient (e.g. 400 calls per frame for a 20x20 grid) and causes performance drops on the frontend.
**Action:** Always batch grid drawing or repeated lines into a single path using `ctx.beginPath()`, `ctx.moveTo()`, `ctx.lineTo()`, and finally `ctx.stroke()`.
## 2024-05-24 - Avoid array methods like .flat() and .filter() for simple counting in critical paths | **Learning:** Using `.flat().filter().length` on multidimensional arrays creates multiple intermediate arrays, leading to unnecessary allocations and slower execution times, especially in hot paths like game state evaluation. | **Action:** Use nested loops instead of array methods to count elements in a multidimensional array.
